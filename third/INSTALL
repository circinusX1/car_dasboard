		QtRadio

To compile and install, run installer.sh and answer a question about
LIRC support. Or, manually (in QtRadio-0.9.0 directory):

qmake main.pro
make
make install

If You want to enable LIRC support:

qmake -config lirc main.pro
make
make install

Sorry, no autodetection yet (hence config.h is unused).

Packagers can use the commands:

qmake -config lirc main.pro
make
rm -rf /tmp/package-qtradio
mkdir -p /tmp/package-qtradio
make INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/package-qtradio install

and the contents of /tmp/package-qtradio will contain all the files
that should be installed relative to / directory.

By default shared files go into /usr/local/share/QtRadio, but
You can change this via variable SHARE_DIR that is defined in
the file config.pri. To change the location of QtRadio binary,
which is /usr/local/bin, either edit src.pro or move qtradio
to another place manually.
